# Smile-Box-Chocolate

Travelling on a flight with a kid is not an easy task. It makes you and
your fellow passengers uncomfortable in case your kid is crying.

The best way to tackle this problem is to distract kids by giving him/her
chocolate. when he/she smiles. So , my idea is that I will make a
Smart- chocolate-box (with the power of azure services).
Whenever kids will smile in front of the chocolate-box a chocolate
falls down. That is how we are able to make kids distracted. So that it
will make an easy journey for passengers and fellow passengers.
